FILE : flower-classification-CNN.py
OUTPUT : trained CNN model's weight 

* Specified the rows and columns as 32 (to use 32x32 image)
* Color channels as 3 (For RGB)
* Loaded the downloaded dataset situated at the home folder after resizing to 32x32
* Changed the image dimension ordering for the backend
* Declared the labels array with the corresponding flower value ( Daisy - 0, Dandelion - 1, so on)
* One hot encoded labels and stored to dummy_y
* Shuffeled the dataset
* Split the dataset to test and train
* Defined a CNN with
 - 3 Convolution2D layers and 3 MaxPooling2D layers
 - Followed by a 128 node nerural net layer
 - Last layer with number of classes(5) and softmax activation
* Compiled using adam optimizer
* Defined checkpoints to save the best weight
* fit the model with training sets
* plotted the epochs v/s accuracy graph
* Evaluated the model printing the accuracy
* Loaded external image to test
* Made prediction and displayed it


FILE : CNN-model-from-weight.py

* Loaded the saved weight
* Compiled the model
* Saved the model

FILE : flowers-CNN-make-prediction.py

* Loaded the saved model
* Loaded the image to make prediction
* Applyed needed image dimension ordering
* Made precdiction and displayed the accuracy - 72% - could be improved by increasing the number of pixels
