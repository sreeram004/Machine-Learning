IRIS DATASET

source : UCI
data item count : 150
classes : 3

Coded using Keras with Tensorflow backend.

 * Different classifier models like SVM, NB, KNN etc. are trained on the X_train set and best model was selected. - I got best results with SVM ( 96.67% )
 * SVM was fitted on the full dataset X
 * A testData from outside the training data was provided and made prediction
 * Prediction was printed out

Comparing the model or Finding the accuracy level

 * Prediction was done on the validation set - X_validation
 * Compared with the Y_validation set using accuracy_score() function
 * Result was displayed
