MNIST

Training Sample : 60000
Evaluation Sample : 10000

Coded using Keras with Theano backend.

Saved Model in mnistmodel.h5 file

File : cnn-mnist.py

* Loaded Dataset from Keras Datasets
* Reshaped the training and test sets as 28x28 
* Normalized inputs to range 0 - 1
* Enocoded output sets (y_train and y_test)
* Defined cnn model with two Conv2D layers of 5x5 and 3x3, MaxPooling2D layer of 2,2 with 0.2 Dropout
  Flattened and passed to the Dense layers 128->50->10
* Compiled with categorical_crossentropy loss and adam optimizer
* Fitted training set validating on the test set for 20epochs
* Evaluated the model to find the accuracy -  Accuracy of 93% was attained
* Saved the model to disk for future use
* Loaded the model from disk
* Loaded the image to make prediction on and appplied reshaping and normalization
* Predictions were made and displayed
